    <h1>About Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier</h1>
    <a href="/">Back to Home</a>
    <p>The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, an exuberant Irish farm dog, is happy, friendly, deeply devoted, and just stubborn enough to remind you heâ€™s a terrier. The unique wheaten coat is low-shedding but needs diligent care to avoid matting.</p>
